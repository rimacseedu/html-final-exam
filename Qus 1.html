   <p> Meta tags are snippets of text that provide information about a web page's content to search engines and website browsers. They are placed in the HTML code of a webpage and are not visible to site visitors. Here are five common meta tags and their uses:

Title Tag:

Example: <title>Your Page Title</title>
Use: The title tag defines the title of a webpage and appears in the browser's title bar or tab. It's crucial for search engine optimization (SEO) as search engines use it to understand the content of the page.
Meta Description Tag:

Example: <meta name="description" content="A brief description of your page content">
Use: The meta description provides a concise summary of a webpage's content. It often appears in search engine results below the title and influences click-through rates by giving users a preview of what to expect.
Meta Keywords Tag:

Example: <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
Use: Historically, search engines used meta keywords to understand the content of a page. However, most major search engines now ignore this tag due to abuse. It's less relevant for SEO today.
Meta Robots Tag:

Example: <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
Use: The meta robots tag controls how search engines index and follow links on a page. It can instruct search engines to index or not index a page (index or noindex) and follow or not follow links (follow or nofollow).
Viewport Meta Tag:

Example: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Use: The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design. It ensures that the webpage is displayed correctly on different devices and screen sizes by setting the initial scale and width of the viewport.
